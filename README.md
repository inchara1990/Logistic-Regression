# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression using stochastic gradient descent algorithm to classify handwritten digits into two classes- 4 and 8. 
The objective function is the negative log likelihood of the sigmoid function of the dot product of the instance vector
and the weight vector. The weight vector is updated based on the gradient derived until the maximum iteration or the objective function
does not change.
